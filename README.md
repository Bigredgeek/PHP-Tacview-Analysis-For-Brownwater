```

### Cloud Deployment (Vercel)
This project is configured for seamless deployment to Vercel:

1. **Automatic Deployment**: Connected to GitHub for automatic deployments
2. **Serverless Functions**: PHP functions run as serverless endpoints at `/api/debriefing`
3. **Static Assets**: CSS, icons, and data files served from `public/` directory
4. **Modern Configuration**: Uses latest Vercel best practices with `rewrites` instead of legacy `routes`

**Live Demo**: [Deploy to Vercel](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/Bigredgeek/PHP-Tacview-Analysis-For-SOTN)
